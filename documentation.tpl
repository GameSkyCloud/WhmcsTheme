		<h2>How to install <strong>Larw Hosting</strong> ?</h2>
		<p>So after downloading the template follow this <strong>steps</strong>!</p><br />
		<h4>1) Uploading files</h4>
		<p>When you download files you can see some <b>.php</b> files folder <b>includes</b> and <b>templates</b> so don't panic , it's so easy for install :)</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>.php</b> files put in your WHMCS ROOT folder</li>
			<li><b>inludes</b> folder , so just click on includes / hooks and upload .php files in your includes / hooks folder</li>
			<li>In <b>templates</b> folder you can see 2 folders <b>larw</b>(main template) , and <b>orderforms</b>.So open your cPanel or FTP and go to WHMCS ROOT / templates and there put <b>larw</b> folder , and just upload orderforms folder <i>don't delete your existing folder <b>orderforms</b> just upload!</i></li>
		</ul>
		<h4>2) Install Template</h4>
		<p>Oke we just now upload all files which we need to make our template work!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Open yourhosting.com/admin and login.Go to System Settings / General and swich template to <b>Larw</b> template.</li>
			<li>When we are already in General, go to Security Tabs and find <b>Allow Smarty PHP Tags</b> and check <b>Enabled </b></li>
		</ul>
		<p>You may be wondering why this is necessary?<br />
		Well that's because my theme contains an API that has PHP code in it and the site needs to activate PHP for that function to work.</p>
		<h2>How to edit Homepage or Game/Web Pages?</h2>

		</ul>

		</ul>
		<h2>Addons</h2>
		<p>The addons you can see on the site were approved by the main creator of them and a very skilled man <a href="https://www.christeris.com/">Chris Teris</a> <br />
		So what is it about?<br />
		A contract has been signed that in addition to my topic, you can also buy a restyled version of the addon, which will of course cost another amount of money.
